## Alarm Clock
Are you in need of a lightweight, portable alarm clock that swiftly gets the job done? You are in the right place, Alarm Clock is just the right tool for you!

## Features
* Lightweight and easy to use.
* Multilingual support (the available languages are English and Persian for now).
* Capable of starting with windows and checking for updates automatically.

## Notes
.NET 6 Desktop Runtime (either x86 or x64 depending on the .exe architecture you download) is required to run the program. You can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). (**Make sure to download the '.NET Desktop Runtime' version!**)

Alarm Clock is not able to wake the system up at the moment. This feature is to be implemented in a future release.
